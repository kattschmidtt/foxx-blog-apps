Hi! My name is Kat Schmidt (I go by Foxx in video games usually) and this is my blog :)
The purpose of this blog as a way to keep track of programming projects that I can show off

In order to get mapbox running register on this [website](https://mapbox.com) and plug in your access token into the env.js file under the accessToken value.

To integrate the backend with the front end go to the [mongodb](mongodb.com) and register. Then go to the server/.env file and add your username and password to the MONGO_URI value.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://link-to-project
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm i
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm start
```
Runs the front end portion of the app in the development mode.\

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view frontend in your browser.\
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view api in your browser.
